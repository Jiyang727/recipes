Ingredients:
 - 380g Barilla Fettuccine
 - 120g Primo Gourmet Selection Pancetta, roughly chopped
 - 1 small brown onion, finely chopped
 - 500ml Massel salt reduced chicken style liquid stock
 - 2 eggs
 - 1 egg yolk
 - 1 cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese
 - Fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped, to serve

Directions:
 1. BCook pasta in a large pan of boiling water according to packet directions or until al dente. Drain well and return to the pan.
 2. Meanwhile, heat a medium non-stick pan. Cook the pancetta and onion, stirring often for 3-4 minutes or until lightly golden and a little crisp. Remove from pan.
 3. Add the stock to the pan and heat until almost boiling. Remove from the heat.
 4. Whisk the eggs, yolk and some freshly cracked black pepper in a large heatproof bowl. Gradually whisk in the warm stock until combined. Do this slowly so the eggs donâ€™t scramble.
 5. Add the pancetta and half the cheese to the hot pasta. Pour over the egg mixture and toss to combine. Leave for 2-3 minutes to soak up the egg mixture and thicken slightly.
 6. Serve pasta topped remaining cheese and extra pepper. Scatter with fresh chopped parsley if you like.
